                        <p>My Hero Academia (Japanese: 僕のヒーローアカデミア Hepburn: Boku no Hīrō Akademia) is a superhero[8] manga series written and illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi. It has been serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 2014,[9] and 20 volumes have been collected in tankōbon format. The story follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without superpowers (called quirks) in a world where they have become commonplace, but who still dreams of becoming a hero himself. He is scouted by the world's greatest hero, who shares his quirk with Izuku after recognizing his potential, and later enrolls him in a high school for heroes in training.

                                The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Bones. Its first season aired in Japan from April 3 to June 26, 2016,[10] followed by a second season from April 1 to September 30, 2017, then a third season from April 7 to September 29, 2018,[11] and an animated film titled My Hero Academia: Two Heroes was released on August 3 of that year.[12]
